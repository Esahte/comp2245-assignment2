                    <p>
                        Something I'm scared of? Oh, I suppose monsters. There are many types of monsters in this world,
                        monsters who will not show themselves and will cause trouble, monsters who abduct children, monsters
                        who devour dreams, monsters who suck blood, and monsters who always tell lies. Lying monsters are a
                        real nuisance, they are much more conning than other monsters. They pose as humans even though they
                        have no understanding of the human heart. They eat even though they've never experienced hunger.
                        They study even though they have no interest in academics. They seek friendship even though they
                        do not know how to love. If I were to encounter such a monster, I would likely be eaten by it,
                        because in truth, I am that monster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet, perhaps there is hope even for a monster like me. For in acknowledging my own capacity for
                        deception and superficiality, I can strive to change. The very awareness of these monstrous traits
                        within me can serve as a catalyst for self-improvement. It is through self-reflection and a sincere
                        desire to understand the human heart that I may begin to shed the monstrous facade and reveal the
                        potential for genuine connection and empathy that lies beneath. So, in my fear of monsters, I
                        paradoxically find a path towards becoming more truly human.

                <h2>Perfection</h2>

                    <p>
                        In this world, nothing perfect exists. It may be a clich√© after all, but it's the way things are.
                        That is precisely why ordinary men pursue the concept of perfection, its infatuation. But,
                        ultimately, I have to ask myself, what is the true meaning of being perfect? And the answer I came
                        up with was nothing. Not one thing. The truth of the matter is I despise perfection. If something
                        is truly perfect, "that's it." The bottom line becomes that there is no room for imagination, no
                        space for intelligence or ability or improvement. To men of science like me, perfection is a dead
                        end, a condition of hopelessness. Always strive to be better than anything that came before you,
                        but not perfect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, let us embrace the beauty of imperfection, for it is in our flaws and the endless pursuit of
                        improvement that the essence of progress and innovation resides. In the imperfections, we find the
                        space to grow, the freedom to dream, and the endless opportunity to push the boundaries of what is
                        possible. Imperfection is the canvas upon which our greatest achievements are painted, and it is in
                        this ongoing journey towards betterment that we discover the true meaning of our existence.
